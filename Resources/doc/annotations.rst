Annotations
-----------
@PreAuthorize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This annotation lets you define an expression (see the expression language
paragraph) which is executed prior to invoking a method::

    <?php
    
    use JMS\SecurityExtraBundle\Annotation\PreAuthorize;
    
    class MyService
    {
        /** @PreAuthorize("hasRole('A') or (hasRole('B') and hasRole('C'))") */
        public function secureMethod()
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

@Secure
~~~~~~~
This annotation lets you define who is allowed to invoke a method::

    <?php
    
    use JMS\SecurityExtraBundle\Annotation\Secure;
    
    class MyService
    {
        /**
         * @Secure(roles="ROLE_USER, ROLE_FOO, ROLE_ADMIN")
         */
        public function secureMethod() 
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

@SecureParam
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This annotation lets you define restrictions for parameters which are passed to
the method. This is only useful if the parameters are domain objects::

    <?php
    
    use JMS\SecurityExtraBundle\Annotation\SecureParam;
    
    class MyService
    {
        /**
         * @SecureParam(name="comment", permissions="EDIT, DELETE")
         * @SecureParam(name="post", permissions="OWNER")
         */
        public function secureMethod($comment, $post)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

@SecureReturn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This annotation lets you define restrictions for the value which is returned by
the method. This is also only useful if the returned value is a domain object::

    <?php
    
    use JMS\SecurityExtraBundle\Annotation\SecureReturn;
    
    class MyService
    {
        /**
         * @SecureReturn(permissions="VIEW")
         */
        public function secureMethod()
        {
            // ...
            
            return $domainObject;
        }
    }
    
@RunAs
~~~~~~
This annotation lets you specifiy roles which are added only for the duration 
of the method invocation. These roles will not be taken into consideration 
for before, or after invocation access decisions. 

This is typically used to implement a two-tier service layer where you have 
public and private services, and private services are only to be invoked 
through a specific public service::

    <?php
    
    use JMS\SecurityExtraBundle\Annotation\Secure;
    use JMS\SecurityExtraBundle\Annotation\RunAs;
    
    class MyPrivateService
    {
        /**
         * @Secure(roles="ROLE_PRIVATE_SERVICE")
         */
        public function aMethodOnlyToBeInvokedThroughASpecificChannel()
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    class MyPublicService
    {
        protected $myPrivateService;
    
        /**
         * @Secure(roles="ROLE_USER")
         * @RunAs(roles="ROLE_PRIVATE_SERVICE")
         */
        public function canBeInvokedFromOtherServices()
        {
            return $this->myPrivateService->aMethodOnlyToBeInvokedThroughASpecificChannel();
        }
    }

@SatisfiesParentSecurityPolicy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This must be defined on a method that overrides a method which has security metadata.
It is there to ensure that you are aware the security of the overridden method cannot
be enforced anymore, and that you must copy over all annotations if you want to keep
them.
