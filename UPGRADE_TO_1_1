This document details all the possible changes that you should investigate when 
upgrading your project from JMSSecurityExtraBundle 1.0.x to 1.1:

- The configuration option "secure_controllers" has been removed. This setting is
  now automatically enabled, but it requires the JMSDiExtraBundle.

- The dependencies of this bundle have changed:
  
    * The metadata library master branch is now required instead of the 1.0 version.
    * The JMSAopBundle is now required.
    * The JMSDiExtraBundle is now required if you want to secure your non-service
      controllers (if you only have service controllers, you don't need it).
